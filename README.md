## On Contributing to the Codebase

### Branches
To keep the development flow clean, it's advised to create your own branch and work from there. The name of the branch does not matter, just make it as easily identifiable as possible.

### Commits
To make sure your commits are organised, best you label your commits on what feature or module they belong to. Examples include:  
- F1: Added so-and-so code in the AJAX script
- F3: Cleaned up logic in so-and-so function

You should also tag issues that are associated with the commit you're making, simply include `#x` in the commit message, replacing `x` with the issue number.

### Pull Requests
Once your commits are pushed to your branch, create a pull request (PR) through your respective branch page on GitHub. There, it should have a green button at the top saying `Compare & pull request`. Click on it, and it should automatically generate most of the details for you. The only missing detail would be the name of the PR. Similar to commits, the pull request must include:
- the module the commits belong to, and
- a short description of the pull request

Then, if all is well and the changes can be merged automatically, according to GitHub, you may do so. Otherwise, if there are merge conflicts that needed to be resolved, you may contact @neallithic64 for additional details.

## On Opening Issues in the Repository

### Detailing
To ensure that debugging and fixes are done efficiently, please try to include comprehensive details, including:
- Feature and Module
- Steps to reproduce the bug
- Lines of code where the problem may be originating (you can do that by opening the file in question, then clicking or shift-clicking the line numbers at the left, then copying the permalink from there)

### Assignment and Tagging
Don't forget to assign the issues with the appropriate contributor/s and tag them with the appropriate tags.

## A Short Crash Course on Visual Studio Code and GitHub

### TL;DR
Most of the work (pulling, committing, staging, pushing) are done through VSC, then making a PR, like what was mentioned earlier, would be done over at GitHub.
