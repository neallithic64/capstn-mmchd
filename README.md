## On Contributing to the Codebase

### Branches
To keep the development flow clean, it's advised to create your own branch and work from there. The name of the branch does not matter, just make it as easily identifiable as possible.

### Commits
To make sure your commits are organised, best you label your commits on what feature or module they belong to. Examples include:  
- F1: Added so-and-so code in the AJAX script
- F3: Cleaned up logic in so-and-so function
You should also tag issues that are associated with the commit you're making, simply include `#x` in the commit message, replacing `x` with the issue number.
